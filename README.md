# Steady

## Overview

### Project Steady

It is about steady progress regarding your habits
(especially getting rid of bad habits, I hope).

### Playground

This is my playground project. I am learning Vue and Typescript on it.

Experimenting, trying to find best folder structure and
file organization, best architecture for async data management,
best DRY approach, tests, etc.
